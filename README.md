# Temperature-Profile-Simulation
Temperature profile simulation in MATLAB for FDM Additive Manufacturing Process
The simulation system's in-process and post-process monitoring and measurement capabilities are a combination of physically informed and machine learning models, demonstrated by the generation of acceptable and faulty instances of the test geometry. Manufacturing issues are also monitored to keep the model within safe and acceptable elongation and stress limits.
The filament is fed from the filament tank to the extruder head and prints the heated filament layer by layer. It is an appealing method to be used for the manufacturing of high-performance polymer-based parts. This paper extensively investigates the FDM process and reviews other journals which deal with:
1.	In process monitoring of part geometry using computer vision and digital twin. 
2.	Simulation of temperature profile of filaments being printed
The objective of this course project is to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify defects as the printing process occurs. The project also uses KNN clustering to understand the basis on which the clustering happens. Lastly, a simulation model of the temperature profile of filaments is designed.
